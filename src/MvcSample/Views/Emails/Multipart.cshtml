Subject: A complex email with alternative views

@* This is how to create an email with multiple alternative bodies. 
   This view is called "Multipart.cshtml", so the alternative views will be called
   "Multipart.Text.cshtml" and "Multipart.Html.cshtml".

   See ~\Views\Web.config for the added references to Postal,
   meaning we can remove the noisy '@using Postal' from the top of this file.
